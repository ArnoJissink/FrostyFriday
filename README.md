# FrostyFriday
https://frostyfriday.org
Welcome to Frosty Friday, a series of weekly challenges released every Friday to help you practice and develop your Snowflake skills, created by Snowflake users, for Snowflake users. Each challenge will be based on one Snowflake feature; from time travel, to pipes, from data transformation to streams.
